# Springboard

When I created this repository I had never used Github before and therefore created a mess.

**Apologies for how unorganized everything is**

Most of the notebooks that can be found here are guided assignments, case studies, and other resources that helped me learn the various topics under Data Science and Machine Learning umbrellas. In tandem with the University of North Florida, Springboard provided educational and mentoring support that equates to about one year on the job training. Everything from setting up my coding environment, to learning *Python, SQL, and Tableau*, as well as the professional expectations of delivering data driven decision support to non-techinical audiences were covered throughout my time at Springboard.

**My plans for the future**

At the time of this writing, I hope to gain empolyment as a Data Analyst / Data Scientist in the finance space. Educationally, I hope to gain a Masters of Science in Data Science to gain deeper insights on how computational processes solve complex problems.

## Future Improvements 
1. Organize content into folders
2. Ensure raw data is organized with the correct folder
3. Write overview README files for each assignment
4. Extract and include visualizations for each project
